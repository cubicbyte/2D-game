# What is this game?

This is my browser game that combines the best mechanics of Terraria and Minecraft. Created in order to improve algorithmic thinking and overall programming skills.

## What's implemented here:
- [x] Dynamic block updates, which allowed to implement 2 pieces below
- [x] Water physics, like in Terraria, but on "minimal"
- [x] Sand with gravity
- [x] Cave generation using Perlin's noise algorithm
- [x] Ore generation, which, however, is now only decorative at the moment :/
- [ ] And also...

Honestly, I forgot what else is there, because I decided to finish writing the README only almost a year after the last time I touched the code. But this project is not abandoned yet! I'm still itching to get back to this beautiful project, which I will do when the time comes.
